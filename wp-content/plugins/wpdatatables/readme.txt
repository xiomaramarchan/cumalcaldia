The best WordPress table plugin. Create responsive, searchable, sortable tables and charts from Excel (.xlsx, .xls or .ods), CSV, XML, JSON and PHP.

== Description ==

wpDataTables is a popular WordPress table plugin used to **quickly create tables & table charts** from Excel, CSV, XML, JSON, PHP and other data sources. Use our WP table plugin to represent vast amounts of complicated data in concise, user-friendly way using tables or charts.

The main benefits wpDataTables provides to its users are **saved time** (as it automates displaying data in website and allows to do so without investing time in coding) and **no need to learn coding** (creating a WordPress table like in wpDataTable would require development without it).

== Amazing WordPress Table Builder ==

New table builder is introduced in wpDataTables – [Creating simple WordPress tables from scratch](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-new-wpdatatables-with-table-constructor/creating-a-simple-table-with-wpdatatables/). These tables can be anything but simple, though, as you can now merge cells, style each cell differently, add star ratings to cells, media and so much more.

Here is the list of the new functionality in those simple tables:

* Merge cells
* Excel like editor
* Responsive mode
* Add/Remove columns and rows
* Resize/Reorder columns and rows
* Cell custom formatting
* Font family and font size
* Undo/Redo
* Add star rating
* Custom links
* Add media
* Custom HTML editor
* Shortcode in cells
* NEW Border options

== Create Responsive Table very easy –

Responsiveness is a feature that allows presenting the same content differently depending on the display size of device that is used to view it. In other words, the same website can be presented differently on a laptop, mobile phone or a tablet.
Any wpDataTable can be responsive table, it doesn’t matter which data source do you use – CSV, JSON , Excel, or any other. In this WordPress responsive table plugin you can choose which columns do you want to be visible or hidden on tablets and/or mobiles. The hidden columns' data will be still available for the users that would like to see it in a dropdown; it will collapse under an expandable block in the first visible column. More about process of creating a responsive table in our docs [Responsive table in WordPress](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/responsiveness/).
Your tables will be 100% functional, and they will look great on all screen and devices.

== Create WordPress table from Excel ==

Microsoft Excel is a very powerful tool and one of the most efficient software for graphic-analytical and tabular data processing. It speeds up and make work in the workplace tables easier, easy to learn, easy to use and fast in displaying work results. It is awesome analysis spreadsheet for many business users. With wpDataTables, it’s even more powerful in WordPress environment. *.XLS* and *.XLSX* formats are also so common for storing data simpler, faster and more intuitive. wpDataTables is deeply integrated with Excel. In just a few clicks you can create awesome WordPress tables with search, sort, pagination, custom skins and lot more. Checkout more details in our documentation about [How to create WordPress tables from Excel files](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-excel/) where you can find and video tutorials as well.

== Make WordPress table from CSV ==

The CSV, or *“comma-separated-values”* is a widely used format; It is lightweight, simple, can be generated by almost any software, and created manually by users. Beside 'comma', wpDataTables support 'colon', 'semicolon', 'vertical bar (pipe) and 'TAB' as CSV delimiter. You can create responsive, searchable and sortable WordPress tables quite easy. You can find detail instructions on the link [How to create WordPress tables from CSV files](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-csv/).

== Generate WordPress table from XML ==

XML - *(Extensible Markup Language)* is a universal standard for presenting data. It is one of the most widely used standards for data transfer between the server and the client. It is increasingly used as a standard in which documents are saved (Libre Office and Microsoft Office). Finally, the HTML standard for creating web pages is derived from the SGML or XML standard. A lot of web services “run” on XML, and wpDataTables supports XML as an input data source as well. Find in our docs [How to create WordPress tables with XML](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-xml/).

== Build WordPress table from JSON ==

JSON *(JavaScript Object Notation)* is a popular interlingual data exchange format. Many server applications provide public data in JSON format. JSON is based on the syntax of Javascript objects. Since most web applications use client-side JavaScript, JSON has become the 'de facto' standard for packing data on the web and wpDataTables also supports the JSON format as an input data source.
Learn [How to create WordPress tables from JSON](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-json-input/) in our documentation.

== NEW! Cache tables data ==

We are introducing a new feature that will dramatically increase the loading performance of your tables created from existing data sources like CSV, Excel, XML, JSON, and PHP array. As you know, in this case, you will upload the file and initialize the table, whereupon it will be read every time the page loads. Before this version of wpDataTables, if the source file was larger than 3.000 – 5.000 rows, the page load and generation time was slow. But not anymore!
More details in our docs about [Caching tables in Wordpress](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/caching-data-and-auto-update-cache-in-wordpress-tables/).

== NEW! Auto update table cache from source file ==

This new option is related with previous option caching tables. If you are updating your source file frequently, and want to keep the data in the table updated after a custom interval, the new feature Auto update cache from the source file will be perfect for you. It will update table cached data based on the source file following the time interval that you will set in the cron job. You can read more in our docs about [Auto update cache from source and cron job instructions](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/caching-data-and-auto-update-cache-in-wordpress-tables/#auto-update-cache).

== Develop dynamic WordPress table from Serialized PHP array ==

For developer users, or users who are at least somewhat familiar with PHP language, that previous input data sources (Excel, CSV, XML of JSON) are not flexible enough for dynamic data presentation. We didn't want to limit your freedom in wpDataTables, so we implemented serialized PHP arrays as one of data sources, so you are able to create dynamic datatables. You can prepare data from some private or public API, or use WP Query to get data from your posts, get data by depending on some variables in the URL, or use some other complex logic. Learn how you can prepare a PHP file and [How to create WordPress tables based on serialized PHP arrays](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-serialized-php-array/) in our docs.

== Create Responsive Charts ==

Responsive Charts in wpDataTables can be created with a step-by-step chart creation wizard in WordPress admin. On each step you can go back to change the settings with huge number of customization options. In the “Formatting and preview” step, you can see a live chart preview, so you can check if you’re satisfied with the look of the chart before saving it and inserting it to a WordPress post or page. More about chart wizard and chart customization options in our docs about [How to create responsive charts in WordPress](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/wpdatacharts/creating-charts-wordpress-wpdatachart-wizard/).

== Editing charts ==

Editing charts with wpDataTables plugin is very easy – everything is done with the same wizard used to create them – the only difference is, the data is already prefilled. The editing steps are the same as the steps used to create the chart. More on link [Editing charts in WordPress](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/wpdatacharts/editing-charts-in-wordpress/).

== NEW! Grouping data in Charts ==

Charts in wpDataTables have a very useful feature: grouping - the values of the rows with the same label will be summed up and rendered as a single series. It is quite easy to set the grouping for a chart with single option "Group chart" in chart wizard. More in our docs about [Grouping data in WordPress Charts](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/wpdatacharts/grouping-in-charts/).

wpDataTables allows creating 14 different chart types using the Google Charts rendering engine:

* Google Line Chart - [Live example](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/wpdatacharts/google-charts/#google-line-chart)
* Google Column Chart - [Live example](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/wpdatacharts/google-charts/#google-column-chart)

Creating tables, datatables and charts with a WordPress tables plugin has never been easier. It only takes 3 basic steps:

**Step 1 - Provide table data**

You can provide table data for WordPress tables by uploading Excel, CSV , JSON, XML or Serialized PHP array, or you will create simple table from scratch with new WordPress table builder.

**Step 2 - Customization**

You can customize and configure the columns of your WordPress table (rename, reorder, add CSS classes, add prefix or suffix, hide, change colors) and also you can customize and configure table Color and Font settings( Font, Header, Table border, Row , Cell and Pagination) in any way you see fit.

**Step 3 - Publish in a post or page**

All tables (except simple table)  will become sortable and will have pagination, global search, display length and export table buttons by default. Once you are happy with the design of your WordPress table, you can easily insert it on any post or page through [Gutenberg](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/gutenberg-editor/), [standard WP Editor and shortcode](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/wpdatatables-shortcodes/), or through page builders like:

* [Avada Page Builder](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/avada-builder-integration/),
* [Divi Page Builder](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/divi-builder-integration/),
* [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/visual-composer-integration/) or
* [Elementor](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/elementor-integration/).


== Export table data and column visibility (Table tools) ==

Additionally, each table (except simple table) can have a search bar, display length, table info, pagination and can have the following export functions: “Copy to Clipboard”, “Export to CSV”, “Export to PDF”, “Export to XLS”, “Print“. Beside those export buttons, it is available column visibility button as well, with which you are able easily to control the visibility of columns in a WordPress table on back-end and front-end as well.
All these functionalities are configurable, and it is your decision whether to toggle these on or off. More info in our docs about [Table tools in wpDataTables](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/table-tools/) and [Table and column settings](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/table-configuration-page-overview/) (simple table has own customization panel).

== Global, individual and multiple columns sorting ==

wpDataTables can act as a sortable table plugin by supporting sorting for all the data types. Tables rendered by the wpDataTables plugin are sortable by default (except simple tables). It means that the content of the datatables can be ordered by the values of one of its columns. When the sorting is enabled, each column header will become “interactive”. If you need to sort by multiple columns, it is possible with “Shift” button on the keyboard. While holding it you are able to click on other columns' header(initially, the ordering will be done based on the first column, and after that, based on the second column).
Detail explanation you can find in our documentation about [Creating a sortable table in WordPress](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/sorting/).

== Column types and features ==

Following column data types are supported in data tables (Data tables created from Excel, CSV, JSON, XML or Serialized PHP array). Most column types, except the images, have their own sorting rules:

* String -  [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/string-columns/)
* Integer - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/integer-columns/)
* Float -   [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/float-columns/)
* Date -    [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/date-columns/)
* DateTime - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/datetime-columns/)
* Time -    [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/time-columns/)
* Image -   [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/image-columns/)
* URL link - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/url-link-columns/)
* E-mail link - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/e-mail-link-columns/)

== Row grouping ==

If one column of your table contains similar values for many rows, it often makes sense to use it as a “group column”.This means it will not be displayed as a column, but its values will be used to group the rows.
For detail explanation check out [How to set up row grouping in WordPress tables](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/row-grouping/).

== Single cell shortcode ==

Most of the users need to show a single value from their tables. wpDataTables presents dynamic single-cell shortcodes that you can use in many options. There are differences in shortcode parameters depending on the table type. More about [Single cell shortcode](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/single-cell-shortcode/) you can read in our docs.
